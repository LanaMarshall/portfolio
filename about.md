I'm Lana Marshall and I'm a graphic designer.

An Austin native, I moved to New York fresh out of high school to attend Pratt Institute. After a comprehensive study of design, illustration and advertising, I earned my B.A. in Communications Design. I then returned to my hometown where I worked as a freelance graphic designer before joining the team at <a href="http://socialdistillery.com/" target="_blank">Social Distillery</a>, as their resident Graphic Designer.

If you have questions about any of my work or would like a copy of my most recent resume, feel free to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}contact/">contact me.</a>
