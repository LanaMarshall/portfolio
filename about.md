I'm Lana Marshall and I'm a Designer living and working in Austin, Texas.

An Austin native, I moved to New York fresh out of high school to attend Pratt Institute. After graduating with my B.A. in Communications Design, I returned to Austin worked as a freelance designer before joining the team at Social Distillery, a social media marketing startup, establishing the role of Graphic Designer within the agency and working my way up to Creative Director. In 2015, I delved back into the freelance world, which ultimately led me to moovel North America (formerly RideScout). At moovel, I worked with the product design team to create beautiful, functional user experiences for mobile apps in the public transportation and mobility industries until the company closed it's Austin office in 2017. 

I'm currently seeking freelance and contract work in the Austin area until mid July, when I'll be heading to Seattle in search of my next big creative opportunity.
