I'm Lana Marshall and I'm a designer living and working in {{ site.location }}.

Born and raised in Austin, Texas, I moved to New York fresh out of high school to attend Pratt Institute. After graduating with my B.A. in Communications Design, I returned to Austin and worked as a freelance designer before joining the team at Social Distillery, a social media marketing startup, establishing the role of Graphic Designer within the agency and working my way up to Creative Director. In 2015, I delved back into the freelance world, which ultimately led me to moovel North America (formerly RideScout). At moovel, I worked with the product design team to create beautiful, functional user experiences for mobile apps in the public transportation and mobility industries until the company closed it's Austin offices. 

In 2017, I relocated to Seattle, where I worked with Microsoft before joining the team at Smashing Ideas. I'm currently open to freelance gigs.

If you have questions about my work or are interested in working together, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.
