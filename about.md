I'm Lana Marshall and I'm a graphic designer.

An Austin native, I moved to New York fresh out of high school to attend Pratt Institute. After a comprehensive study of design, illustration and advertising, I earned my B.A. in Communications Design. After graduating, I worked as a freelance graphic designer before joining the team at <a href="http://socialdistillery.com/" target="_blank">Social Distillery</a>, establishing the role of Graphic Designer within the agency and working my way up to Creative Director.

If you have questions about any of my work, are interested in working together or would like to check out my resume, head over to my <a href="/contact/">contact page to get in touch.</a>
