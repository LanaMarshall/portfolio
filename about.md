I'm Lana Marshall and I'm a graphic designer.

An Austin native, I moved to New York fresh out of high school to attend Pratt Institute. After a comprehensive study of design, illustration and advertising, I earned my B.A. in Communications Design. After graduating, I worked as a freelance graphic designer before joining the team at social media marketing startup, establishing the role of Graphic Designer within the agency and working my way up to Creative Director. I'm currently seeking my next big creative opportunity.

If you have questions about any of my projects or are interested in working together, please feel free to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.
