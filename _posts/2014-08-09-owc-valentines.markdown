<!-- Other World Computing, an online retailer specializing in hardware upgrades for Apple products, was looking to gain new subscribers to its email list. OWC was particularly interested in capturing a broader audience than its very tech-centric customers. The Social Distillery team decided to tackle this ask by launching a Facebook app and corresponding ad campaign.

I was responsible for leading the project in creative direction. Since the campaign was set to run through the month of February, I thought a Valentine's theme would be relevant and fun. I created a series of Facebook ad graphics that I believed would appeal to a larger audience and drive email subscriptions through humor and familiar imagery. Additionally, I customized the CSS of the Facebook app to look consistent with the ads.

The Results? Ads for this campaign achieved an average Click Through Rate (CTR) of 2.46%, 146% better than the target CTR and 143% better than Decemberâ€™s average CTR. -->
