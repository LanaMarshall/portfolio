  description: "MakerSquare, a coding bootcamp in Austin, and now San Francisco, worked with Social Distillery from 2013-2014. I created a variety of graphics to help MakerSquare promote their comprehensive programs across Facebook and other social media channels. These examples represent just a few of the graphics I created for the MakerSquare Facebook page."

  description: "For SXSW 2015, the newly-opened JW Marriott Austin wanted a campaign that would engage and build relationships with its audience. And they wanted it in a week. The Social Distillery team came up with the #GriffinHunt. We hid 10 griffins (found in the brand's logomark) on local business around downtown Austin in the form of window clings. People were encouraged to find a griffin and Tweet or Instagram a photo of it with #GriffinHunt. This served as their entry to win one of a week's worth of giveaways from JW Marriott. Between our #GriffinHunt hashtag (280K+ impressions), our locally targeted social ads (90K+ impressions), and our organic promotions (62K+), we received over 430K in impressions, plus our reach from pedestrian traffic. Our campaign also helped grow the JW Marriott Austin community by 5% over the span of a week, with members who continue to engage regularly."
