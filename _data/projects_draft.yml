  description: "MakerSquare, a coding bootcamp in Austin, and now San Francisco, worked with Social Distillery from 2013-2014. I created a variety of graphics to help MakerSquare promote their comprehensive programs across Facebook and other social media channels. These examples represent just a few of the graphics I created for the MakerSquare Facebook page."
