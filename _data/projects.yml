  description: "When Social Distillery's CEO came to me looking for a brand update, she wanted to keep the skyline motif of the logo she'd founded the company with, but give it a clean, modern facelift. I cleaned up the lines of the logo, simplified the details and color scheme and added new logotype. The logo update was just part of Social Distillery's brand refresh, which included comprehensive brand guidlines and new brand collateral."
