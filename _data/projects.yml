  description: "RideScout, an Austin startup known for their trip planning app, hired me as a freelancer to create an animated explainer video for their new SDK and mobility network RideTap. The new SDK allowed apps to offer multi-modal, real-time transportation options to their users. </br></br> After completing a series of illustrations and animating them into a one minute video, I was invited to join the RideScout team as a full time Visual Designer to be there for the ideation and launch of RideTap. Once on team RideScout (later moovel), I created a logo, marketing materials, email banners, landing pages and UI design for RideTap and more. </br></br> In May 2016, the RideTap pilot launched in Portland, Oregon with Lyft and Car2go accessible through the TriMet mobile ticketing app, Portland's public transportation agency app."

  description: "After Austin-based RideScout and Portland-based GlobeSherpa began the process of merging to form moovel North America, the offices joined forces to help revamp the white label mobile ticketing app that had been developed by the Portland team and used by transit agencies around the country. One thing lacking in the existing app was a trip planning tool. The moovel team set out to make a clean, functional and user-friendly trip planner that could be utilized in a variety of settings and transit systems. </br></br> My role in this project was UI design. I worked closely with product managers to help translate user testing feedback into design improvements."

The user can switch between views by tapping the list or card view icon to the left of the settings icon. This design is intentionally similar to RideTap so that the two could be integrated at some point in the future. </br>The user's current location is assumed as the starting point, but can be edited. From this screen, the user can swipe through trip options and select their preferred route or access trip and time settings."

The logo update was just part of Social Distillery's brand refresh, which included comprehensive brand guidelines and new brand collateral."

  description: "Other World Computing, an online retailer specializing in hardware upgrades for Apple products, was looking to gain new subscribers to its email list. OWC was particularly interested in capturing a broader audience than its very tech-centric customers. The Social Distillery team decided to tackle this ask by launching a Facebook app and corresponding ad campaign.</br></br>I was responsible for leading the project in creative direction. Since the campaign was set to run through the month of February, I thought a Valentine's theme would be relevant and fun. I created a series of Facebook ad graphics that I believed would appeal to a larger audience and drive email subscriptions through humor and familiar imagery. Additionally, I customized the CSS of the Facebook app to look consistent with the ads.</br></br>The Results? Ads for this campaign achieved an average Click Through Rate (CTR) of 2.46%, 146% better than the target CTR and 143% better than December’s average CTR."
