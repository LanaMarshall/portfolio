  description: "When Social Distillery's CEO came to me looking for a brand update, she wanted to keep the skyline motif of the logo she'd founded the company with, but give it a clean, modern facelift. I cleaned up the lines of the logo, simplified the details and color scheme and added new logotype. The logo update was just part of Social Distillery's brand refresh, which included comprehensive brand guidlines and new brand collateral."

  description: "Other World Computing, an online retailer specializing in hardware upgrades for Apple products, was looking to gain new subscribers to its email list. OWC was particularly interested in capturing a broader audience than its very tech-centric customers. The Social Distillery team decided to tackle this ask by launching a Facebook app and corresponding ad campaign.</br></br>I was responsible for leading the project in creative direction. Since the campaign was set to run through the month of February, I thought a Valentine's theme would be relevant and fun. I created a series of Facebook ad graphics that I believed would appeal to a larger audience and drive email subscriptions through humor and familiar imagery. Additionally, I customized the CSS of the Facebook app to look consistent with the ads.</br></br>The Results? Ads for this campaign achieved an average Click Through Rate (CTR) of 2.46%, 146% better than the target CTR and 143% better than Decemberâ€™s average CTR."
